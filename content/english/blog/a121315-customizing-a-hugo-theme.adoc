Although I liked the appearance of the Airspace theme, it was clear that I would need to make some changes to, minimally, specify the text and background colours, and to provide styling for AsciiDoc-related markup.

Some colours can be altered in the `themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}config.toml` file, but the options are limited:

[source,toml]
.config.toml
----
# customize your color and font from here.
[params.variables]
color_primary = "#655e7a"
body_color = "#fff"
text_color = "#666666"
text_dark = "#333333"
text_light = "#7b7b7b"
border_color = "#ACB9C4"
black = "#000000"
white = "#ffffff"
light = "#f5f5f5"
----

Out the box Hugo processes `.adoc` files using AsciiDoctor provided that AsciiDoctor is installed on your system.
However, most themes don't provide styling for AsciiDoc, so tables, admonitions (notes, tips, cautions and so forth) and code block are unformatted.

At first, I simply overrode some of the Airspace SCSS by adding rules to the `{backslash}assets{backslash}scss{backslash}custom.scss` file, which is imported by default in the `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}assets{backslash}scss{backslash}style.scss` file.

I soon realized, though, that I would need to make more substantial changes.

The Airspace SCSS is not particularly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY]: font and background colours, font sizes, line heights and so on are all individually set, with considerable inconsistency.

For this reason, I did the following:

. Added a `vars.scss` file to `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}assets{backslash}scss`.
. Renamed variables to be more consistent, for example:
+
[cols="m,m",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
| Original |Revised

|$color-primary
|$color-brand-1

|$color-secondary
|$color-brand-2

|$text-color
|$color-text

|===

. Replaced non-DRY rules, such as `line-height: 16px;`, with DRY ones, such as `line-height: $line-height-base;`.
. Replaced absolute measurements (mostly `px`) with relative ones (`rem` or `em`, depending on the context), except for things like border widths.
. Added a `_asciidoc.scss` file to `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}assets{backslash}scss{backslash}templates` and added the line `@import '_asciidoc.scss'` to the end of `style.scss` file.
+
The `_asciidoc.scss` file contains all the rules needed to correctly format the HTML generated by AsciiDoctor.
It's not yet comprehensive, but it's easy to add new rules as required.
. Added a `github.scss` file to `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}assets{backslash}scss{backslash}templates` and added the line `@import 'github.scss'` to the end of `style.scss` file.
The `github.scss` file contains the SCSS required to apply GitHub-style syntax highlighting to code blocks processed by the https://rouge-ruby.github.io/docs/[Rouge] syntax highlighter, which is bundled with AsciiDoctor.
+
--
TIP: Run `rougify style github > github.css` to output the CSS to a text file. Then use https://www.cssportal.com/css-to-scss/[CSS to SCSS Converter] to convert the file to SCSS.

Making changes directly to the theme SCSS files does mean that I won't be able to automatically apply theme updates, but I don't get the sense that themes are regularly updated.
--
. Added the following entry to the `/<root-folder>/config/_default/config.toml` file:
+
--
[source,toml]
----
[markup.asciidocExt]
[markup.asciidocExt.attributes]
source-highlighter = "rouge"
----

This activates the highlighter for all AsciiDoc files in the project.
