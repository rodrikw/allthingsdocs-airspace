Initially Netlify was configured to build off the main branch and I made edits directly to the main branch on my local Git.
This meant that whenever I pushed changes back to GitHub, Netlify triggered a new build.
This didn't provide enough control and resulted in too many builds.

I tried setting up a prod branch and configuring Netlify to build off that, but this resulted in a poor GitHub workflow: GitHub expects changes to branches to be contributed back to main, not the other way round.
So now Netlify builds off the main branch but I develop on dev.
This results in the following workflow:

. In GitHub Desktop, I refresh my local copy of the dev branch (I don't always do this because I'm currently the only one working on the site).
. Make my changes to the site contents.
. Commit the changes to the dev branch in my local Git.
. Push the changes to GitHub.
. Create a pull request.
. Merge the changes into main.
