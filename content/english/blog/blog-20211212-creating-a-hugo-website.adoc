The basic setup of Hugo on your local computer is easy, and well documented:

. Go to the folder in which you want to create the Hugo site structure.
In my case this was `C:{backslash}Users{backslash}__UserName__{backslash}Documents{backslash}`
. Run the command `hugo new site _yoursitename_`.
+
TIP: In a Windows environment, I recommend using https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/[Windows Terminal].
+
The result will be a new site with the following folders and files:
+
----
archetypes
content
data
layouts
resources
static
themes
.hugo_build.lock
config.toml
----

However, you can't run the Hugo server until you apply a theme.
I initially chose the https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/navigator-hugo/[Navigator theme] but after a while swapped to using the https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/airspace-hugo/[Airspace theme].
I liked the fact that the newer Airspace theme uses https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss[SCSS] rather than plain CSS.

To install the Airspace theme, do the following:

. Go to https://github.com/themefisher/airspace-hugo and click *Code > Download ZIP*:

. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
. Rename the resulting folder from `airspace-hugo-master` to `airspace-hugo`.
. Copy the folder into the `themes` folder in your new Hugo site.
. In the `airspace-hugo` folder, go to the `exampleSite` folder.
. Copy the contents of the `exampleSite` folder:
+
----
assets
config
content
i18n
static
nelify.toml
----
. Go to the root folder of the Hugo site and paste the contents.
This will replace the empty folders that were in the root folder.
. Go to the `themes` folder and delete the `exampleSite` folder.
. Return to the root folder and run the command `hugo server`.
You should now see a URL at which the generated site is available:
+
`Web Server is available at ++http://localhost:1313/airspace/++ (bind address 127.0.0.1)`
