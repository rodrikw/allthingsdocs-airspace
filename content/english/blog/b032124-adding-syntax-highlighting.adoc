description: "How to add Rouge syntax highlighting to AsciiDoc pages in Hugo."
draft: true
type: "post"

The use of AsciiDoc markup in Hugo depends on AsciiDoctor, which supports a number of syntax highlighters:

* highlight.js
* CodeRay
* Pygments
* Rouge

All but highlight.js are build-time highlighters, which apply the highlighting when the site is generated.

I chose Rouge because it supports a large number of languages, unlike CodeRay, and does not require Python, unlike Pygments.

There are two ways to implement Rouge:

* Using a Rouge theme
* Using a CSS file

In either case, you need to first install Rouge:

. Open a terminal in the root folder of your Hugo project and run the command `gem install rouge`.
. In the root folder, open the `gemfile` and add an entry for Rouge:
+
.gemfile
[source]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'asciidoctor'
gem 'rouge'
----

. Update the `gemfile.lock` file by running `bundle update`.
The file should then look something like this:
+
.gemfile.lock
[source]
----
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    asciidoctor (2.0.17)
    rouge (3.28.0)

PLATFORMS
  x64-mingw32

DEPENDENCIES
  asciidoctor
  rouge

BUNDLED WITH

== Using a Rouge theme

This is the simpler approach:

* Add the following entry to the `/<root-folder>/config/_default/config.toml` file:
+
[source,toml]
----
[markup.asciidocExt]
[markup.asciidocExt.attributes]
source-highlighter = "rouge" <.>
rouge-css = "style" <.>
rouge-style = "base16.solarized" <.>
----
<.> Activates the Rouge highlighter.
This is equivalent to adding `:source-highlighter: rouge` to the top of each AsciiDoc file that you create in your Hugo content folders.
<.> This setting tells Rouge to download and apply the specified theme.
The default value is `class`.
<.> This is the name of the theme you want to use.
Use the https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/[Rouge Theme Preview Page] to choose a style.

== Using CSS

This approach is a little more complicated, but it allows for tweaking the CSS to suit your site:

. Download the Rouge theme that you want to use from https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/tree/HEAD/lib/rouge/themes.

. Run `rougify style _[red]#yourstyle#_ > _[red]#yourstyle#_.css` to output the CSS to a text file.

. If your hugo theme uses SCSS, use https://www.cssportal.com/css-to-scss/[CSS to SCSS Converter] to convert the file.

. Add the `.css` or `.scss` file to the relevant templates folder in your Hugo theme.
For example, I added my file to `<root-folder>/themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/templates/`

. Add an `@import` rule to the end of your `style.scss` file.
For example, I added  `@import 'github.scss'` to the end of `<root-folder>/themes/airspace-hugo/assets/scss/style.scss`

. Add the following entry to the `/<root-folder>/config/_default/config.toml` file:
+
[source,toml]
----
[markup.asciidocExt]
[markup.asciidocExt.attributes]
source-highlighter = "rouge" <.>
