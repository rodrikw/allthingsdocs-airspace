AsciiDoctor-Diagram is an extension of Asciidoctor that enables you to create diagrams using plaintext directly in your AsciiDoc files.
Asciidoctor-Diagram supports a number of formats, including:

* http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[DITAA]
* https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid[Mermaid]
* https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML]

For example, PlantUML markup can be used to create a sequence diagram:

[source,asciidoc]
----
.PlantUML diagram
[plantuml,target="sample-plantuml-diagram",format=svg]
....
@startuml
!theme lightgray
Merchant -> Acquirer: 0100 Auth request
Acquirer -> Issuer: 0100 Auth request
Acquirer <-- Issuer: 0110 Auth response
Merchant <-- Acquirer: 0110 Auth response
... On completion: ...
Merchant -> Acquirer: 0220 Tran advice
Acquirer -> Issuer: 0220 Tran advice
Acquirer <-- Issuer: 0230 Tran advice response
Merchant <-- Acquirer: 0230 Tran advice response
@enduml
....
----

This results in:

.PlantUML diagram
[plantuml,target="sample-plantuml-diagram",format=svg]
....
@startuml
!theme lightgray
Merchant -> Acquirer: 0100 Auth request
Acquirer -> Issuer: 0100 Auth request
Acquirer <-- Issuer: 0110 Auth response
Merchant <-- Acquirer: 0110 Auth response
... On completion: ...
Merchant -> Acquirer: 0220 Tran advice
Acquirer -> Issuer: 0220 Tran advice
Acquirer <-- Issuer: 0230 Tran advice response
Merchant <-- Acquirer: 0230 Tran advice response
@enduml
....

To add Asciidoctor-Diagram functionality to Hugo, I did the following (using the instructions provided by Andreas Longo in https://www.andreaslongo.com/blog/things-i-learned/asciidoc/diagram-hugo/[Generate diagrams with Asciidoctor and Hugo]:

. Added an entry for Asciidoctor-Diagram to the `Gemfile` file in to project's root folder:
+
[source%linenums,highlight=4]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'asciidoctor'
gem 'asciidoctor-diagram'
gem 'rouge'
----

. Ran the command `bundle` to install the Asciidoctor-Diagram gem locally and update the `Gemfile.lock` file.

. In the `<root-folder>/config/_default/config.toml` file, I added the following highlighted lines:
+
[source%linenums,toml,highlight=2..3;5]
----
[markup.asciidocExt]
    extensions = ["asciidoctor-diagram"]
    workingFolderCurrent = true <.>
    [markup.asciidocExt.attributes]
        diagram-cachedir = ".cache"
        experimental = true
        source-highlighter = "rouge"
        relfileprefix = "../"
        relfilesuffix = "/"
----
+
<.> The https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#external-helper-asciidoctor[Hugo documentation] states that this is required when using Asciidoctor-Diagram.

. Added `--destination public` to the build command: `hugo --minify --gc --destination public`.
According to the https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#external-helper-asciidoctor[Hugo documentation], this is required if using an external Asciidoctor command.
In my case, I updated the command in the `package.json` file, but it could also be in the `netlify.toml`, both of which are in the root folder.

. Added the `<root-folder>/content/english/blog/.asciidoctor` folder to `.gitignore`.
This folder fills up with lots of temporary files, as well as the output diagram files.

Although it is convenient to be able to create diagram using plaintext, I'm not entirely sure that adding this functionality to a Hugo site run on Netlify is a good idea.
Doing so means that each time the site is built, the diagrams are re-generated, adding time and build minutes to the process.
