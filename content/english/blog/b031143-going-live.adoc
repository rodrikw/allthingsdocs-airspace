Today I registered `allthingsdocs.com` through Netlify.
The registration process is remarkably simple:

. Log in to Netlify.
. Choose the site for which you wish to register a domain.
The assumption is that you already have a site with a `.netlify.app` address.
. Click btn:[Set up a custom domain].
. Enter your proposed domain name and verify it.
If the domain name is available, you will be quoted a registration fee.
. Accept and enter your credit card details.

A few seconds later your registration will be complete, including an SSL/TLS certificate provided by https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt], and the site will be live.
By far the hardest part for me was deciding on a name -- I'm still in two minds about the name but I needed to take the plunge.
