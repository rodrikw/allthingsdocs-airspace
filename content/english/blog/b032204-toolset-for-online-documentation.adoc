I spent quite some time last year investigating options for an online documentation toolset.
I wanted toolset that would meet the following requirements:

* Free and open source (FOSS) as far as possible.
Low cost is generally attractive but I was motivated more by the desire to be able to plug into active communities.

* Widely used and actively supported.

== Markup

I investigated reStructuredText (RST) and Markdown before stumbling across AsciiDoc, and I nearly committed to RST.
Within a week of starting to use AsciiDoc , it was clear that it was preferable to the other two.
My reasons can for liking it can be summed up as:

Flexibility::
AsciiDoc has pretty much all the features I need: flexibles lists and tables, linking and embedding, text variables, conditionals, and so on.

Enjoyability::

AsciiDoc is easy and enjoyable to use.
Unlike RST, it does not rely on indentation, which is fiddly, and its markup is generally easy to remember. Compare:

.reStructuredText
[source,rst]

.. note::
   This is note text.
----

.AsciiDoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
NOTE: This is note text.

Some people might object that it is not as widely used as Markdown, and that's true.
But it is, I believe, sufficiently widely used, particularly by technical documenters.

== Editors

In my view https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html[IntelliJ IDEA] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin[AsciiDoc plugin] is the clear leader for among the various options for editing AsciiDoc.

== Static site generator

Antora is a specialized static site generator intended to convert Asciidoc content into documentation sites.

== Version control

Git is predominant among developers.
In the context of a docs-as-code approach, it makes sense to adopt Git as the version control for documentation too.

Some people might object that it is unnecesarily complex for requirements of documenters.
I'm somewhat sympathetic to this as I initially found the porocess of committing chnages to the local repo and then pushing them to the remote repo quite confusing -- let alone pull requests and merging.
