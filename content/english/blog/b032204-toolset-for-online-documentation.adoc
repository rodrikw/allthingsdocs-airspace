It can be daunting to put together a toolset to create and deliver online documentation.
I know because I spent a number of months in 2021 investigating options and proposing a toolset for a software company to which I was consulting.

I wanted a toolset that would meet the following requirements:

* Free and open source (FOSS), as far as possible.
Low cost is generally attractive, but I was motivated more by the desire to use tools that would be widely available within the organisation (rather than be restricted to the documentation team), and that would prevent proprietary lock-in.

* Widely used and actively supported.
Even a technically excellent tool is likely to be a poor choice if it has little or no traction.

Although it was not part of my initial set of requirements, I early on decided to focus on a Jamstack solution rather than one employing a content management system such as WordPress.

== Core components

The core components of a Jamstack solution are:

* Markup and a suitable editor
* Version control
* Static site generator
* Hosting solution


=== Markup

After six years of using a conventional help authoring tool and earlier experience using DITA, I wanted to try creating documentation using a light-weight markup language.
I investigated https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html[reStructuredText^] (RST) and https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown^] before stumbling across https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc^].
Within a week of starting to use AsciiDoc, it was clear that it was preferable to the other two.
My reasons can for liking it can be summed up as:

[horizontal]
Flexibility::
AsciiDoc has virtually all the features I need:
* Flexible lists and tables
* Linking and embedding, including linking to external code
* Text variables
* Conditional content, and so on

Ease of use::

AsciiDoc is easy and enjoyable to use.
Unlike RST and Markdown, it doesn't rely on indentation, which I find fiddly.
Compare:

.Markdown

   - Step 1a.
   - Step 1b.
2. Step 2.
----

.AsciiDoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
. Step 1.
* Step 1a.
* Step 1b.
. Step 2.

Markdown prioritizes readability of the source, while AsciiDoc prioritizes editability.
It is possible to indent sublists if you wish to, but it's not required.

By comparison with RST, AsciiDoc syntax is generally easier to remember.
Compare:

.reStructuredText
[source,rst]
----
.. note::
   This is note text.
----

The space between the periods and "`note`" and the alignment of "`This`" with "`note`" are both required.

.AsciiDoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
NOTE: This is note text.
----

Markdown might beat both in this regard but that's partly because it's less powerful.
It doesn't, for instance, include admonitions such as notes and tips.
--
// End indent

Some might object that AsciiDoc is not as widely used as Markdown, which is true.
But it is, I believe, sufficiently widely used, particularly by technical documenters.
It's also supported by GitHub and GitLab.
Of course, if you already have an entrenched Markdown user-base among the developers, then it might not be worth trying to introduce AsciiDoc.

If you choose AsciiDoc as your markup language, that affects your choice of editor and static site generator.

=== Editor

In my view, https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html[IntelliJ IDEA^] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin[AsciiDoc plugin^] is the clear leader among the various tools available for editing AsciiDoc.

The community edition of IntelliJ IDEA is free, and it includes many features that are useful to technical writers:

* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie/[Grazie^], a spelling, grammar, and style checker.
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/#version-control[Git and GitHub/GitLab integration^].
* The ability to define file templates and https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html[live templates^].
For example, I have created a live template to quickly insert the date and time in ISO format: `2022-05-05T11:26:38+02:00`
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/#instant-navigation-and-search[Project-wide search and replace^].

To the base functionality, the AsciiDoc plugin adds:

* Instant preview of the markup as you type.
* A toolbar for inserting tables, images, and links:
+
image::{imgpath}b032204-intellij-asciidoc-plugin-toolbar.png[alt="IntelliJ AsciiDoc plugin"]
* Code folding, which enables AsciiDoc sections and blocks to be collapsed or expanded.
* Live templates for inserting a wide range of AsciiDoc markup.
* Reformatting the source, for example, adjusting empty lines around headings and enforcing a https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[one-sentence-per-line convention^].
* Validation of the AsciiDoc source, for example, highlighting broken images and deprecated syntax.
* The ability to quickly generate PDF and HTML previews.
* Support for Antora projects, which greatly facilitates tasks such as inserting cross-references or links to images.

IntelliJ isn't perfect.
For technical writers, there are numerous menus and options that are not relevant to them.
It would be preferable if there were some way to hide these.

An alternative to IntelliJ plus the AsciiDoc plugin is https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX^], which might better suited to writers who are new to AsciiDoc and who require more support with the syntax.
However, I don't recommend it if you are intending to use Antora as the static site generator because it doesn't offer the Antora support that the IntelliJ plugin does.

=== Version control system

https://git-scm.com/[Git^] is the dominant version control system (VCS) for open-source projects, and it's widespread in other environments too.

Some might object that Git is unnecessarily complex for the requirements of documenters.
I'm somewhat sympathetic to this as I initially found the process of committing changes to the local repo and then pushing them to the remote repo quite confusing -- let alone managing pull requests and merging.

Nevertheless, I think that in a context where the product development team uses Git, it makes sense for documenters to do so too:

* Technical reviewers are more likely to access the source content for review than if it is stored in another VCS, let alone a content management system.
(On the other hand, Git is less likely to be accessible to reviewers from business or marketing, so you might need to resort to outputting content to PDF for them.)
* The publication process can be more easily integrated into the product release process, and the DevOps team are more likely to be willing to undertake such integration.

Of course, if the development team uses another VCS such as Subversion, that might well dictate what the documentation team uses.

NOTE: Antora expects content to be stored in one or more Git repos, so choosing Antora will likely dictate the use of Git.

==== Git host

GitHub and GitLab are the two most widely used cloud-based Git hosts.
For my purposes, there didn't appear to be much to distinguish the two.
I've found GitHub easy to use, and it offers many useful features such as https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows[workflows^].
Both GitHub and GitLab are easily integrated with Netlify.

In most cases, the determining factor in choosing a Git host (cloud-based or on-premise) will be what the development team uses.

==== Git clients

If you do decide to use GitHub, you'll probably want to install https://desktop.github.com/[GitHub Desktop^].
It makes tasks such as pushing changes to GitHub or branching a repo much easier than doing so using the command line.

I also regularly use the Git functionality provided by IntelliJ IDEA to commit and push files quickly and easily.

=== Static site generator

A static site generator (SSG) is required to aggregate your AsciiDoc content and other assets, and convert them into a structured site.

https://antora.org/[Antora^] is a specialized static site generator intended to convert AsciiDoc content into documentation sites.
It provides a lot of functionality out of the box that would otherwise be tricky to replicate with a more generalist SSG:

* The ability to aggregate content drawn from multiple Git repositories.
* Support for multiple versions of documents in a unified site.
A version menu enables users to easily swap between versions of a document:
* Source-to-source navigation, which means that cross-references are defined in the source documents independently of the output, greatly facilitating their management.
* The ability to easily structure content and define navigation.

Antora has some limitations:

* At present, it does not support multilingual sites by default, although it is possible to add the necessary functionality using extensions.
* It does not yet support automatic generation of PDFs, but development of this functionality is well advanced (as of 5 May 2022).

Antora _is_ a niche player.
It's not nearly as widely used as the likes of Gatsby, Jekyll, or Hugo, but it is being very actively developed and has a committed and https://antora.zulipchat.com/[helpful community^].

=== Hosting solution

There are numerous options for hosting your site.
Some provide pure hosting while others also provide "`serverless`" backend services, meaning that they provide cloud computing resources on demand for tasks such as site generation.
https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify^] falls into the second category.

I chose Netlify because it seemed that a significant proportion of the Antora sites that I visited were hosted on Netlify, including the official https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antora Documentation^] site.
I have been impressed with the ease of use and functionality it offers (I particularly like its https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/[preview functionality^]), not to mention that it has a free https://www.netlify.com/pricing/[Starter tier^].

== Supporting tools

The tools listed below are not essential, but they are useful.

=== Screen capture software

I've used https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html[Snagit^] for so long that I'm willing to pay for the relatively low licence fee.

=== Bitmap image editing

For simple editing of PNGs and JPEGs, I most often use Snagit's editor.
https://www.gimp.org[GIMP^] is the default FOSS option, although it's overkill for my purposes.

=== Diagraming tools

My preferred tool for creating diagrams and exporting them as SVGs remains https://www.microsoft.com/en-za/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software[Visio^].
It is powerful and generally easy to use.
Unfortunately, it's pricey.

I've also used https://www.diagrams.net/[diagrams.net^] (formerly draw.io) and while it isn't comparable to Visio, it can be used to create very acceptable SVG diagrams.

=== Vector image editing

For SVG images, https://inkscape.org[Inkscape^] is the obvious FOSS choice.
It's powerful (certainly exceeding anything I might require), although it's not always entirely intuitive.
