:source-highlighter: rouge

The Airspace blog template includes an image at the top of the blog.
I like to make use of Creative Commons images but these usually require an attribution.
Unfortunately, the Airspace template didn't make allowance for that.

I had feared that adding the ability to define an attribution in the header the blog would be complex, but it turned out to be pretty simple.

Inspection of the source of a blog page indicated that I was looking for a `<div class="post-thumb">`.
This occurred in a number of layout files but the one I wanted turned out to be in `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}layouts{backslash}_default`:

[source,html]
----
<div class="post-thumb">
            {{ with .Params.image -}}
            <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ . | relURL }}" alt="{{ $.Title }}">
            {{- end }}
</div>
----

I decided to wrap the `<img>` tag in a `<figure>`, which would allow me to add a `<figcaption>` element:

[source,html]
----
<div class="post-thumb">
            <figure>
                {{ with .Params.image -}}
                <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ . | relURL }}" alt="{{ $.Title }}">
                {{- end }}
                  <figcaption>
                    Caption goes here
                  </figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
----

I wanted to be able to add a parameter to the blog header, like this:

[source]

title: "Adding a caption to blog images"
date: 2021-12-17T10:58:07+02:00
author: "Rodrik Wade"
image: "images/blog/new_image.png"
image_caption: "<a href='https://www.example.com/'>Title of Image</a> by <a href='https://www.example.com/'>Creator's name</a>, <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/'>CC by 2.0</a>, cropped" <1>

<1> The new parameter

I thought I would have to implement some way of extracting this new parameter but in fact https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/#user-defined[fields added to the front matter] are automatically placed into the `.Params` variable, so the field I added could be accessed as `.Params.image_caption`:

[source,html]
----
<div class="post-thumb">
            <figure>
            {{ with .Params.image -}}
              <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ . | relURL }}" alt="{{ $.Title }}">
            {{- end }}
                <figcaption>
                  {{ .Params.image_caption }}
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
----

This worked with plain text captions but not with those that included HTML.
The solution was to add the `safeHTML` function:

[source,html]
----
<div class="post-thumb">
            <figure>
            {{ with .Params.image -}}
              <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ . | relURL }}" alt="{{ $.Title }}">
            {{- end }}
                <figcaption>
                  {{ .Params.image_caption | safeHTML }}
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
----

The final step was to add an SCSS rule to `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}assets{backslash}scss{backslash}templates{backslash}_single-post.scss` to format the caption:

[source,css]
----
 figcaption {
    color: $color-text-light;
    font-size: $font-size-smaller;
    font-style: italic;
    margin-top: 0.1em;
    }
