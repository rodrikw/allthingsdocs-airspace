AsciiDoc provides a lot of control over images, and this functionality is available to blog authors.

For reasons that are not clear, the path to images needs to include `/airspace`/, for example: `image::/airspace/images/blog/kitten.jpg[]`.


image::/airspace/images/blog/kitten.jpg[]

Images can be resized:

image::/airspace/images/blog/kitten.jpg[alt=kitten,width=200]

The can also have captions:

.A cute kitten
image::/airspace/images/blog/kitten.jpg[alt=kitten,width=200]
