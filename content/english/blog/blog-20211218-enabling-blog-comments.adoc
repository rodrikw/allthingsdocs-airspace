Most blogs allow readers to post comments, and enabling comments is easy to do using one of the many commenting services.

My criteria for choosing a commenting solution were the following:

* Should be a service.
I didn't want to deal with the complexity of containers or other types of installation, even if these do provide more control.
* Should have a free tier with reasonably generous limits.
I want to try comments out and don't want to commit myself to payments.
* Should have reasonable payment tiers.
In the unlikely event that I would need to move to a paid tier, I don't want it to be too expensive -- under USD{nbsp}10 a month is good.
* Should be easy to install.
* Shouldn't have ads or dubious tracking.
* Should allow anonymous comments.

There are lots of comment services that can be used with Hugo.
The Hugo documentation provides a https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#alternatives[list of alternatives] to Disqus (the de facto default).
Janne Kemppainen provides https://pakstech.com/blog/hugo-comments/[a summary] of many of them.

In the end, I decided on https://graphcomment.com[GraphComment] for these reasons:

* It has a free tier that allows a very generous 1 million views a month.
* The first paid tier is a reasonable $7.00 a month.
* GraphComment is a French company that has to comply with European data standards such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation[GDPR], which makes me feel more comfortable.
As does the fact that their clients include _Le Monde_.

GraphComment also has https://graphcomment.com/en/features.html[lots of features], including theme colours, a notification centre for users, easy registration (through Facebook, Twitter, or Google), text formatting, and media embedding.

To set up GraphComment, I followed the instructions provided in https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/graph-comment-setup-in-2-minutes/34925[Graph Comment setup in 2 Minutes].
This didn't quite work for me -- Something was off with the shortcode.
As I quickfix, I simply moved the code directly into the `{backslash}themes{backslash}airspace-hugo{backslash}layouts{backslash}_default{backslash}single.html` layout file:

[source,html]
----
<div id="graphcomment"></div>
          <script type="text/javascript">

            /* - - - CONFIGURATION VARIABLES - - - */

            var __semio__params = {
              graphcommentId: "id-specified-during-sign-up", // make sure the id is yours <1>

              behaviour: {
                // HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
                uid: "{{ .Permalink }}", // unique identifer for the comments thread on your page (ex: your page id) <2>
              },

              // configure your variables here

            }

            /* - - - DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE - - - */

            function __semio__onload() {
              __semio__gc_graphlogin(__semio__params)
            }


            (function() {
              var gc = document.createElement('script'); gc.type = 'text/javascript'; gc.async = true;
              gc.onload = __semio__onload; gc.defer = true; gc.src = 'https://integration.graphcomment.com/gc_graphlogin.js?' + Date.now();
              (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(gc);
            })();
          </script>

<1> This is the ID that _you_ specify during the sign-up process.
<2> This is an ID that uniquely identifies the blog post.
Following the advice of Janne Kemppainen in https://pakstech.com/blog/hugo-comments/[Hugo Comments], I inserted `{{ .Permalink }}`.

The appearance of GraphComment is clean and unobtrusive, especially after changing the theme colour:

There are a few instances of Franglais in the UI text, but nothing too serious:

One thing to note is that each time Hugo Server rebuilds, it counts as a page view.
So it is possible to add a lot of page views editing the site.
Probably not a million in a month, but still.
To avoid this, I followed the advice given in https://msfjarvis.dev/posts/integrating-comments-in-hugo-sites-with-commento/[Integrating comments in Hugo sites with commento] and wrapped the code in an `{{ if -}} {{- end }}` block:

[source]
----
{{ if (not .Site.IsServer) -}}

â‹®

{{- end }}
----

This ensures that the comment functionality is not included when previewing the site on my computer.

When a comment is posted, I receive an email notification with links that enable me to approve the post or moderate it:

The *Moderate this message* link opens the GraphComment dashboard:

There I can approve, reply, delete, or mark the message as spam.
