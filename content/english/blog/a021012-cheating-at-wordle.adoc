Like half the English-speaking world, I have been playing Wordle every morning.

I decided to see if I could write a script to cheat Wordle -- purely as an exercise, you understand.

The first thing to do was to find a suitable Word list. I didn't want a list of Scrabble words, since that's not how Wordle work. https://github.com/dolph/dictionary/blob/master/popular.txt[Popular.text] is a list of about 25,000 of the most commonly occurring English words, which seemed a good starting point. Also, the wordlist uses American spelling, as does Wordle, is lowercase and includes no digits.

The next step was to extract all the five-letter words into a separate list:

. Open the file in Notepad++.
. Select the *Regular expression* option.
. In the *Find what* field enter the regex `\b\w{5}\b`
. Click *Find all in current document*.
This returns 3088 words.
. Save the list.
