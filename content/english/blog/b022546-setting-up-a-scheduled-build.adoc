A common approach to updating a doc site is to build the site on a regular automated schedule, for example, daily at midnight.
Netlify itself has recently introduced https://github.com/netlify/labs/blob/main/features/scheduled-functions/documentation/README.md[scheduled functions] but it's still a beta feature.
Eric Jinks in https://ericjinks.com/blog/2019/netlify-scheduled-build/[Schedule your Netlify build with GitHub Actions] has detailed an alternative method that involves creating a buildhook in Netlify and then adding it to a GitHub workflow.

The assumption is that you have already created an Antora playbook project for the site and have set up continuous deployment on Netlify, as described in xref:../b022246-configuring-antora-ci-on-netlify.adoc[Configuring continuous integration of an Antora project on Netlify].

To create the buildhook:

. In Netlify, select the relevant site and click *Site settings*.
. From the left menu, click *Build & deploy*.
. Click *Add buildhook*.
. Provide a name for the webhook.
For example, `Trigger <my-site> build`.
. Specify the branch to build.
. Click *Save*.
. Copy the buildhook.

To add a workflow in GitHub:

. In the playbook project, create a `/.github/workflows` folder.
. Create a `main.yaml` file with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
.main.yml
----
# .github/workflows/main.yml

name: Trigger Netlify Build
on:
  schedule:
    # Run daily at midnight UTC
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  build:
    name: Request Netlify Webhook
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Curl request
        run: curl -X POST -d {} <your_build_hook>
----

. Push the changes to the playbook project to the GitHub repo.
+
This creates a workflow that runs at the scheduled time.
When run, a CURL request containing the buildhook is sent to Netlify, triggering the build of the site.

You can monitor the workflow in GitHub:

. Select the workflow repo.
. Click btn:[Actions]:
