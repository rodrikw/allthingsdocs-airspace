  title: "ABOUT THIS SITE"
  content: "I am interested in recent documentation trends such as the docs-as-code approach, use of lightweight markup languages, and sites employing a Jamstack architecture. 
This site is an attempt to put what I've learnt into practice. 
I'll be trying out new things and gradually expanding the site. This does mean that the sight might be a bit rough around the edges.


I am recording what I've done and what I've learnt along the way in my blog."
